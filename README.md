# SiteUnblocker
Extension to bypass domain name blocks using Google Public DNS.

This extension will retrieve the correct IP of a blocked site using Google Public DNS and connect to the website by directly using its ip address in the address bar.

Some sites only work over https. You'll receive a "your connection is not private" warning, but you can bypass this by clicking "advanced" and "proceed".

Won't work on servers using http/2.

Extension available on chrome web store:
